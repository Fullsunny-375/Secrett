        Helloo po baobao ko, iwan ko to sayo kasii la lng ehehe I'm not doing 
        this because it's valentine's, it's purely coincidence!! hehehe
        pero, anyway ayun nga mmm ang tagal na natin magkasama, there 
        are so many things I want to tell you, I guess I'll put some here. Ready?
        Hi mahal, mmm paano ko ba to sisimula HAHAHA okay I just want 
        to take this time to appreciate you,
        and all the things we've been through. 
        I love ever single moment we shared, not just because of what we did
        but because I got to experience those moments with you. I don't 
        regret anything at all, from the moment I confessed life took a turn
        lalo na siguro sayo AHAHA I wouldn't want this any other way, I'm 
        so happy it's you. From the day we started talking, all the movies 
        and shows we watched, all the games we played, all the random 
        things we talked about, the quiet daysss, and all the arguments we fixed, 
        I'm grateful for all those moments! I look forward to more with you
        if you would still want to be with me hehe. I also want you to know
        that I will support every decision you take, maybe, if it's a bad
        decision I will do anything in my will to stop you AHAHA I'll always
        be with you po, and I'll always be yours okay? Thank you for everything
        you've done for me up until now. I'm so grateful po sayo!   
        And all the effort you've put in, I notice all your hardwork 
        and I'm impressed I know you've been trying hard talaga and
        masaya po ko, proud po ko, I notice and I see you po. I promised
        that I'd be better for you, mmm it's still in the process hehehe
        pero I hope you know that I love you fully and that's no joke
        I'd never joke or lie about that, and that I'd never do anything to
        hurt you po, so if I do something that you don't like just tell me yeah?
        Tell me how you want to be loved and treated and I'll do it for you po
        I know for some people being with someone long enough 
        then losing the spark things start to change, 
        and I hope that you wouldn't love me less even if we 
        don't have that spark for a little while hehe. Pero I'm not forcing 
        for you to love me back, I love you po, and that's what I want
        I want you to know that you're loved and na may pake sayo palagi
        I don't have to be the one you tell every random thing to
        but if the world starts treating you harshly you can come to me
        I can be your safe place instead:) I know things have been hard
        with us kasi you have your problems and I have mine, and it's ok
        if we aren't okay for a while I know things aren't going how we want
        them to go but I promise I'll be with you always even at the hardest
        points of our lives. You'll always be the one I love and will always be
        my bestest friend and favortie person, when things are hard and 
        confusing you'll always be the one I want to figure things out with 
        I know being with me has probably been challenging and hard:( 
        and I'm sorry I haven't been able to do much, but I'm slowly trying
        to change the bad habits I have, I promised you too didn't I?
        so I really am I'm sorry if it's been hard on you, I'll change
        slowly mhm. You've been sosososooo patient with me baobao and 
        I don't know how to thank you for everything you've done,
        that's why I think angg lakas mo po, even if you don't feel like it
        you've been going through alot and here you are still persevering 
        I know it's been hard for you for a long time now, and I want you 
        to atleast feel safe and feel better when you're with me I know
        I've been giving you a hard time to, so that's why I hope one day
        when you're ready you can tell me and I'll do what I can to help okay?
